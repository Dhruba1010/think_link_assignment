## How did I did this project ? 

First of all, I created the Navbar.

Then, I divided the whole page into two parts: the first part is the sidebar and the second part is the main content section.

Then I make an array of objects with all the logos and links of the sidebar. Then I designed single component for the link ans map through the array and for each object return the component with different properties based on the object.

For the main content section, I created one div for overviews of orders, one div for sales profit section and one div for inventory section.

In the overviews of orders section, I created one component for order details, then created one array of objects with all the logos, links, colors, and values. Map through the array and return the same component with different properties.
